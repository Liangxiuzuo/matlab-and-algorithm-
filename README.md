for the purpose to find the near-optimum matix of 0 or 1

how it is used:
    randommatirx77=randint(7,7) or randerr(7,7,4) , then final77=searchmaxcode(randommatrix77,100)
   it denotes that a matix of 7*7 is generated randomly,and then use the GS1 or GS2 algorithm to find the near-optimum aperture arrays.
  but there is a lot to be improved as the local-max how to be resolved, maybe for the reason of criteria of Q (quality funciton) is not masterd and the Great Deluge Algorithm is not used. However the solution must exits!
